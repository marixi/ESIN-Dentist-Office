# ESIN-Dentist-Office
Authors: Duarte Rodrigues & Mariana Xavier

This repository is dedicated to the ESIN 2020/2021 project. Its objective is to implement a website for a dentist office and manage its database.

On the homepage of the website can be found information regarding the clinic such as the services it performs, the team involved and contacts in order to reach it.
There is also a link to the place where the login can be performed, redirecting the website to the profile of the user with its unique characteristics. One common characteristic of the profiles is beign able to see the information regarding their profile and to edit them at any time.

## Dentist:
* The dentists can see their schedule for any week desired, in which the appointments link to the next page, containing more detailed information.
* The page concerning the appointments is divided in three sections:
    1. Future appointments: appointments which are former to the current date/time, in which they can choose the auxiliary they want to assign to each appointment or leave it blank if desired.
    2. To be completed appointments: appointments which are prior to the current date/time and in which the fields of "service performed" and "observations" still need to be filled.
    3. Past appointments: appointments which are prior to the current date/time and where the dentists can change the observations at any time.
* For the appointments, they can choose to view the appointments all at once or search for a specific customer.
* They also have the "Manage Team" page, in which they can hire or fire new dental auxiliaries for the clinic.

## Dental Auxiliay:
* Similar to the dentists, dental auxiliaries can also view their schedule and record of appointments.
* There is a difference in the appointments page, since they can't change any of the fields regarding it, so it is only divided in past and future appointments.
* On the "Manage Material" page, they can view the current stock and add or remove items individually or for a complete service, following the "Material per Service" guide.
* They also have the "Manage Clients" page, in which they can add or remove new clients for the clinic. 
* As dentists and dental auxiliaries can also be clients of the clinic, there is an option for inserting an employee as a client.

## Clients:
* Clients have the option to book appoointments according to the clinic availability.
* The booked appointments and the past ones can be viewed in the record of appointments and they can choose to unbook one of the future ones.

As said before, employees may also be clients of the clinic. In those cases there is a button to change between profiles.
